Hi! Im TheMagnificentMiles

I love to:
  - Code
  - Game
  - Code games

Im currently a High School Student in NY, USA

I have been coding since I was like 10 (alot of that being blockly/scratch), but I now know:
  - Python
  - Some java
  - Some c#

and I'm trying to learn c++.

Thanks for sitting through this: Miles

Ps. my favorite colors to mix together are:
  - White
  - Really dark gray
  - Light woody tan
  - Green
  - And sometimes a light blueish

Pps. I'm by no means good at design, as my known languages show, sorry that this doesnt look good.
